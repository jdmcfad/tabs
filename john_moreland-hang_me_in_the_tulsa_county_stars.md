Capo ~5

```
G              D/F#         G
Hang me in the Tulsa County stars
C/G                         G
Hang me in the Tulsa County stars
Em              G         C/G               G
Meet me where I land if I slip and fall too far
G              D/F#         G
Hang me in the Tulsa County stars

G               D/F#              G
I don't want to come back down to earth
C/G                                   G
No, I don't want to come back down to earth
Em                  G              C/G          G
My heart is growing heavy from the ever-endless hurt
G                  D/F#              G
So I don't want to come back down to earth

    G       C/G                                         G
And babe, I know this life will make you cold and leave you mad
         G              D/F#           Em
Make you homesick for a home you never had
                D/F#              G
Burning out the good with all the bad

   G               D/F#               G
So darling let the charmers leave the room
C/G                                G
They're drowning out the Nashville moon
  Em            G               C/G
I want to learn exactly who you are
     G              D/F#         G
Then hang me in the Tulsa County stars

[Solo]

G              D/F#          G
Find me in the Indian Nation sky
        C/G                          G
You can find me in the Indian Nation sky
        Em                   G                 C/G              G
When it feels like nothing's real and no one's standing on your side
G                   D/F#          G
Just find me in the Indian Nation sky

G                  D/F#        G
I'd set ablaze the secrets I'd concealed
C/G                           G
I'd set ablaze the secrets we conceal
   Em               G        C/G             G
If I could make you feel the way you make me feel
G                  D/F#       G
I'd set ablaze the secrets we conceal

    G       C/G                                          G
And babe, I know this world will have the wolves outside your door
         G                  D/F#            Em
Make you leave all that you love to fight a war
                   D/F#              G
And never tell you what you're dying for

   G               D/F#               G
So darling let the charmers leave the room
C/G                          G
Let them have that Nashville moon
  Em           G               C/G
I want to know exactly who you are
     G              D/F#         G
Then hang me in the Tulsa County stars
     G              D/F#         G
Just hang me in the Tulsa County stars
