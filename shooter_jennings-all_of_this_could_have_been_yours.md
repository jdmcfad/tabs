E                      C   D
I had a cure, for your disease
                 E 
But you threw it away
                                           C        D
And you made it clear i was not welcome on these seas
 
                     E 
And you threw it away
 
     G            D          E 
So I sailed and i sailed for so long
   G              D              E 
My hair grew long and my heart grew cold
       G        D                E 
I face certain death without you near
      G          D               E 
And i felt the storm and swam until the skies were clear
    G          D     A         G       E 
And i found a home along this crooked road
 
    C
And all of this would have been
D                              E 
All of this could have been yours


All of this should have been
D                              E 
All of this could have been yours
 
Em                         A 
Black clouds roll, right over red doors
       Em 
As the waves were high
       A 
So was I
        Em 
And the moon never looked so angry
             A 
As when your walls came crumbling down
 
        C
It was so beautiful
        B
It was so peaceful
 
                        A 
All the destruction, it was quiet
 
C
All of this would have been
D                              E 
All of this could have been yours

( E   C  Am )
 
E                                    C   Am
All that you love, will be carried away
 
E                                    C   Am
Oh, all that you love, will be carried away
 
E 
All of my pain, that you put on my name
C                    Am
All of my doubt, and all of my shame
 
E 
All of my guilt, my denial and fear
C                    Am
All of my hatred and all of my tears
 
E 
All of the time that i couldnt go home
C                       Am
All of the times that i froze all alone
 
E 
All of the sadness all of the lies
C                       Am
All of the shadows that blackened my eyes
 
E 
All of the servants, who cheated, who stole
C                           Am
All of the colors from the depths of my soul
 
E 
All of the wounded, that you left for dead
C                                Am
Now creep in the corner, they're all in my head
 
E 
All of the dreams that you made nightmares
C                      Am
All of the silence, deafening stares
 
E 
All of the ships who can't carry loads
C                      Am
You wrecked in anger, along distant shores
 
C
All of this would have been
D                            A 
All of this could have been yours
 
C
All of this should have been
D                            E 
All of this could have been yours
