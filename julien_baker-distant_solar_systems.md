Distant solar systems and all the minor planets
     A              F#m            D2          A E
Know nothing of our satellites and seven forty sevens

Fireworks that recreate the birth of constellations
A               F#m              D2        A E
Dying suns that laugh at shotgun powder imitations
A           F#m            D2                A E
When I am a sailor and the sky a pitch-black ocean
A                    F#m                D2            A  E
I'll look down at my bleeding heart and wish I were a Vulcan

               D2   A                  E
It's Byzantine structures churches and all
           D2   A              E
All of our treasure of oil and gold
           D2 A               E
All of the empires crumble in stone
           D2 A              E       Esus4
Great architecture gilded in chrome

A             F#m             D2           A  E
God and I, we correspond with intermittent letters
A                F#m                D2           A    E
I send postcards from the road, and now and then He answers
A               F#m             D2             A  E
Echoes Northern city-states and all the mighty kingdoms
A              F#m           D2       A  E
Head of sewing needles on an unending horizon
A           F#m                D2                  A    E
"I knew the words you'd sing before you thought to sing them
A                   F#m            D2               A E
You call yourself a bastard, and I love you like an orphan"

                    D2 A              E
'Cause great men of science and literature
      D2      A              E
Don't impress me, what can I offer?
              D2  A          E
'Cause I am a chisel in Your hand
             D2 A                     E
Screaming at marble from a microphone stand

E       A2
Aaaaaaaaaaaa
