D G/B D G/B

D           G/B
The show is all over
D                    G/B
The house lights are down
      D         G        A
I got paid  and I feel alright
D               G/B
So let's go downtown
D              G/B
I'll buy you a drink
D                G
I'll be broke by tomorrow
G                 A
But I’m flush for tonight


        G         A           D
And the moon is a beat-up old record
G/F♯ G         A             D
This town is a broke down hi-fi
       G                 A
And it all just keeps on spinning
      D            G/B
And I don't hear a thing
         Em         A          D
But your name for a drunk lullaby


G  D  G  D  G


D          G/B
I've got a room
       D          G/B
At the top of the stairs
    D              G               A
The trucks roll by all through the night
    D        G/B
And if I was brave
    D          G/B
I’d be gone by now
   D       G                        A
If I was a fool I’d keep holding on tight


        G         A           D
And the moon is a beat-up old record
G/F♯ G         A             D
This town is a broke down hi-fi
       G                 A
And it all just keeps on spinning
      D            G/B
And I don't hear a thing
         Em          A          D
But your name for a drunk lullaby

    D             G/B
She stands at the window
       D       G/B
With a lit cigarette
D            G              A
Hair falling loose down her back
D           G/B
Catches the sunlight
D             G
Shines like a halo might
  D            G          A
Before someone painted it black


        G         A           D
And the moon is a beat-up old record
G/F♯ G         A             D
This town is a broke down hi-fi
       G/B            A
And it all just keeps spinning
D                  G/B
And I don't hear a thing
         Em         A          D
But your name for a drunk lullaby


G/B  D  G/B  D  G/B  D9
